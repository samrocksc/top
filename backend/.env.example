# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name?schema=public"

# For local development with Docker, you might use:
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/tens_dev?schema=public"
```

Now that I've fixed the Prisma schema file, you need to ensure that your `.env` file contains a valid `DATABASE_URL`.

The error you were seeing was because the Prisma client was being initialized without a proper database connection URL. By adding `url = env("DATABASE_URL")` to the `datasource` block in your `schema.prisma` file, Prisma will now look for the database connection string in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

Please make sure your `.env` file contains a valid database connection string in the format shown in the `.env.example` file I created. For example:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name?schema=public"
```

After updating your `.env` file with a valid database URL, try running `make backend-dev` again. The Prisma client should now be able to initialize properly.
